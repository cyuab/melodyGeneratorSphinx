How to use "math mode" in Sphinx
====================================

Since html does support Math equation in text form, Sphinx generates the Math equation in png format.
The Math equation is in the Latex format.
The following is an example.

:math:`\alpha > \beta`

.. math::

    n_{\mathrm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} s_k n_k
	
	
In other to use Math mode, you need to add the extension to the "config.py".
Don't be worry. I have already added this extension.
