Preface
====================================
Author: Coleman

This section teaches you how to use Sphinx for the documentation. 
Similar to Latex, we use it to generate PDF file from source file (.tex). 
We can use Sphinx to generate website (html) from the source file (.rst). The source file is written in a script called reStructuredText (rst).
	
Sphinx reads rst to generate different kinds of output, such as Latex (so as to PDF), epub (which is an eBook format) and html. For our purpose, we use Sphinx to generate html.
	
Hence, we simply need to learn rst to maintain/update this documentation website. If you want to learn how the outlook of the website looks like, you need to study the config of Sphinx. 
	
Finally, we also need the knowledge from a version control module "git" and a documentation hosting module called "readthedocs" to update the website from local machine to the remote machine.
