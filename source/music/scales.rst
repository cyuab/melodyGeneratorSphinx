Scales
*******************
This page presents the scales I have found in the internet.
Except the standard chromatic scales,
(Major: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half)
(Minor: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole),
they are many other special scales.

Some of them even consists less than 7 notes, such as pentatonic scales.
