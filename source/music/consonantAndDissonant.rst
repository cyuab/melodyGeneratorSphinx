Consonant and Dissonant
**************************
In the Hevner's summary in the book "Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications", there is a row called "Harmony". This attribute has 2 values. They are "simple" and "complex".

I regard "simple" as "Consonant" while "complex" as "Disconnant". I have included the reason in this page.

The following videos explain what consonant and dissonant are. For persons like me that have not received formal music theory training, they can still hear the difference between two.
