Security
---------
The CSE administrator asked Raymond to create a user account for a "tester" to *audit* our security level.


Pushing problem
-----------------
If you cannot push the project, contact Raymond. In the past, the reason that we cannot push the project to the gitlab because the disk of the server do not have enough size. After the admin of the cssystem expands the disk size of the gitlab, it causes some kind of database crash. So, the admin of the cssystem need to reinstall the whole gitlab program. If it is the case, please contact staff of cssystem.

At my time, I used to contact Yau Lam Yiu (yiu@cse.ust.hk).

Ignore Files
--------------
Some of the files in the files may not necessary to be supervised. Hence, you need to write a .gitignore to specify what files are going to be ignored.
