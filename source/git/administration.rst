Administration of the GitLab Server
=====================================

You can log in the gitlab with the admin ac. For the admin account, there is an additional button called Admin Area.  Then, we can do the admin work there, e.g. create new ac, block existing ac, delete existing ac.

The administrator ac and pw can be found in the "adminAcInfo.txt" under the following path.::

	/csproject/kdd/share/melodyGenerator/melodyGeneratorDocument
	
The following is message from Raymond Wong about the administration of the GitLab Server

	From now on, each user should use his "own" account for uploading/downloading the codes. Usually, the administrator account is used when we have some special rights for doing something.
