Preface
========

I recommend you to use Intellij as the IDE for this project. As least I (Coleman) and Pakawadee used it for the development. However, the UG students who start this project use netbean.

There are two versions of it: community version and the ultimate version. The former one is free and the later one is not. I recommend the later one. We can use our ust mail (xxx@connect.ust.hk) to register an education free licence for the ultimate version.
