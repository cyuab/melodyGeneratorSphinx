Coleman's works
================
This session contains useful documents/files for this project. The documents are written by Coleman during his MPhil study. They are original in Coleman's progress website. I have also captured some videos too.

The file name refers to the corresponding task's name. The whole website is placed as::

I have deleted all the irrelvant task of T-Music in the progress website.
