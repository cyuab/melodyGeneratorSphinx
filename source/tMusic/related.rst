====================================

As my understanding, this project starts as a Final Year Project (FYP) by some UG students. Raymond Ka Wai Sze was one of these students. And he is the first one to do programming of this project. He then becomes a research assistant to write this program.
It is then followed by Pakawadee and then Coleman. 

I hope you will enjoy the programming  and please do not blame me. I believe the code is even messy when I received it. And I have no document to read. >_<
